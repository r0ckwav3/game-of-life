An [Atom](atom.io) package that turns selected code blocks into Conway's Game of Life. It is advised not to run this package on any code you do not have a backup of.

### Installation
This package is not currently on the Atom Package Manager, so you'll have to manually install this for now

### Use
Highlight a block of text and run the `step` command, which is bound to `ctl-alt-l` by default.
